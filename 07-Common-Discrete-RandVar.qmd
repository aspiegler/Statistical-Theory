# 2.4: Common Discrete Distributions

---

In statistics, we are typically using data from a sample to make inferences about characteristics of a population. We want to may have claims or questions to test. We may want to estimate some characteristics or <span style="color:dodgerblue">**parameters**</span> of the population. By identifying patterns in the sample data and applying probability, we can build theoretical models to inform predictions about the population. These predictions depend on the level of uncertainty due to sampling, that may be flawed, biased, or simply unlikely. Data and models come in all shapes and levels of complexity.

We will take a look at several of the most common and useful distributions when working with discrete random variables, such as counting the frequency of occurrences in certain classes of categorical variables. There are many more distributions for discrete random variables, some of which we will see later!


# A Case Study in Randomness: Jury Duty

The jury plays the most crucial role in a trial. They determine how cases are ultimately resolved! The jury serves as an impartial reviewer of the facts presented in criminal and civil cases.  The goal of randomly selecting the jury is to remove the bias in the jury selection process. 

> How can we measure whether a jury that has been selected is "representative"?  

A random sample of 12 adults cannot be a perfect representative of the population in all ways. No two distinct random samples of 12 adults is going to be same, yet we hope different juries would rule similarly based on the same set of facts if they are truly impartial. The jury system plays a vital role in the system of justice in the United States, and randomness plays a central role in helping reduce bias in court rulings.

## How Jurors Are Selected

---

The federal judicial branch in the United States decides the constitutionality of federal laws and resolves disputes about federal laws. The federal court system is divided into 94 district courts. The US District Court in the District of Colorado randomly selects jurors from voter registration lists, driver license records, and state-issued adult identification records, by a computerized method. Below is an explanation of how juries are chosen in the District of Colorado. See [The District of Colorado Juror Information](http://www.cod.uscourts.gov/JurorInformation/HowJurorsAreSelected.aspx){target="_blank"} for full details.


> "This selection process creates the courtâ€™s 'Master Jury Wheel'. (This term originated in the days when names were placed into a large barrel-type wheel and turned around to mix them up. Today, computers are used to select names randomly.) From the 'Master Jury Wheel', jurors are randomly selected for a one month term of service or occasionally longer depending on the court's jury needs."

## Question 1

---

Consider the selection of a jury of 5 people. We want to see whether the jury is representative in terms of political party. Note we initially choose a jury of 5 people to more quickly recognize a pattern. After identifying a pattern, we can extend our results to juries of 12 people. Let $Y$ denote a jury member who identifies as an independent voter. Let $N$ denote a jury member who is not independent (identify as Democrat, Republican, or with another political party).

- There is one possible outcome in the event: 0 people on the jury identify an Independent. 
- We can represent that outcome as NNNNN.


### Question 1a

---

List all possible outcomes in the event: Exactly 1 out of 5 jurors is independent.

#### Solution to Question 1a

---


<br>  
<br>  
<br>  


### Question 1b

---

List all possible outcomes in the event: Exactly 2 out of 5 jurors are independent.

#### Solution to Question 1b

---

<br>  
<br>  



# Counting Outcomes

---

Consider a district with $n$ people eligible for jury duty. On the first of each month the court chooses a new pool of $k$ people from which juries will be selected. How many different jury pools of size $k$ can be selected from a population with size $n$?

- There are $n$ possible people that can be chosen first. 
- Then there are $n-1$ remaining possible people that can be selected as person 2.
- Then there are $n-2$ remaining possible people that can be selected as person 3.
- And so until there are $n-(k-1)$ remaining people to select person $k$.

 $$\begin{array}{lclclcccl}
\mbox{choice 1} & & \mbox{choice 2} &  & \mbox{choice 3}  & & & & \mbox{choice k} \\
 n & \times & (n-1) & \times  & (n-2) & \times & \ldots & \times & (n-(k-1)) 
 \end{array}
 = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}.$$

Note the <span style="color:dodgerblue">**factorial**</span> of a non-negative integer $n$ is denoted $\color{dodgerblue}{n!}$ and is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $n$:

$$\color{dodgerblue}{n! = 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times \ldots \times (n-1) \times n}$$


## Ignoring the Order of Selection: N Choose K

---

If we want to count the total number of possible jury pools, and we do not care about the order in which the people are selected, then we want to count the number of <span style="color:dodgerblue">**combinations**</span>. 

- First count the possible outcomes as we illustrated above, taking into account the order in which the jury is selected.
- Then we ignore the order that people are selected by considering the same set of people (chosen in any order) as the same. Using the result that there are $k!$ ways of permuting the order of the $k$ people selected.

Thus, the number of combinations of $k$ items out of a set of $n$, denoted $_nC_k$ also referred to as $n$ choose $k$, is

$$\color{dodgerblue}{\begin{pmatrix} n \\ k \end{pmatrix} = \frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!}.}$$

::: {.callout-note}
See the [Appendix: Why Divide By $k!$](#sec-append-why) if you are curious why we divide by $k!$ when we do not care about the order that the items are selected.
:::



## Question 2

---


Use R to calculate the total number of outcomes in the event: Exactly 2 out of 5 jurors are independent voters.

::: {.callout-tip}
The function `factorial(x)` calculates $x!$ for a non-negative integer $x$.

# Defining a Random Variable

---

Recall random variables map outcomes in a sample space to a subset of the real numbers. In this example, an outcome is 5 randomly selected people for the jury.  We define random variable $X$ to be the number of independent voters on a randomly selected jury of 5 people. For example, we have:

- The outcome NNNNN is mapped to $X=0$.
- The outcome YNNNN is mapped to $X=1$.
- The outcome NNNYN is also mapped to $X=1$.
- The outcome YNNYN is mapped to $X=2$.

We map each outcome to an integer $X$, and then we can compute values of the corresponding probability mass function (pmf) $p(x) = P(X=x)$. 


## Question 3

---

According to a recent article ["Why Independent Voters Are Key To Winning Colorado", PBS News. Oct 3, 2020](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-independent-voters-are-key-to-winning-colorado){target="_blank"}, approximately 42% of Colorado's voters identify as independent.


In solving [Question 2], there is a general pattern we can model to compute the probability of choose exactly $x$ jurors that identify as an independent voters in a jury of 5 people. In this question, we generalize the pattern to answer questions about a jury of 12 people.


### Question 3a

<br>  


### Question 3b

What is the probability of randomly selecting a jury of 12 people with exactly 1 juror that identify as an independent voter?


#### Solution to Question 3b

---


```{r}

```

<br>  
<br>  


### Question 3c

---

What is the probability of randomly selecting a jury of 12 people with exactly 2 jurors that identify as independent voters?


#### Solution to Question 3c

---


```{r}
# Use R to help compute P(X=2)

```

<br>  
<br>  


### Question 3d

---

What is the probability of randomly selecting a jury of 12 people with at most 2 jurors that identify as independent voters?


#### Solution to Question 3d

---


```{r}
# Use R to help compute probability X is at most 2

```

<br>  
<br>  


### Question 3e

---

What is the probability of randomly selecting a jury of 12 people with at least 2 jurors that identify as independent voters?


#### Solution to Question 3e

---


```{r}
# Use R to help compute probability X is at least 2


```


<br>  
<br>  


## Question 4

---
 
A jury of 12 people is randomly selected from a population that is 42% independent voters. Let random variable $X$ denote the number of jurors that identify as an independent voter.


### Question 4a

---

Using your answers to [Question 3], give the values for $p(0)=P(X=0)$, $p(1)=P(X=1)$, $p(2)=P(X=2)$, and $F(2) = P(X \leq 2)$.

#### Solution to Question 4a

---

-  $p(0)=$ ??

-  $p(1)=$ ??

-  $p(2)=$ ??

-  $F(2)=$ ??

<br>  
<br>  



### Question 4b

---

Give a possible formula for the pmf of $X$, $p(x)=P(X=x)$.


#### Solution to Question 4b

---


A formula has been partially completed. Fill in the missing parts.

$$P(X=x) = \begin{pmatrix} ?? \\ ?? \end{pmatrix} (0.42)^{??} (1-0.42)^{??}$$

# The Binomial Distribution

---

## A Trial with Two Possible Outcomes

---

A <span style="color:dodgerblue">**Bernoulli trial**</span> is an experiment that has <span style="color:dodgerblue">**exactly two possible outcomes**</span>:

-   The probability that the outcome of a trial is a <span style="color:dodgerblue">success</span> ($\color{dodgerblue}{X=1}$) is denoted $\color{dodgerblue}{p}$.
-   Otherwise, the probability of a <span style="color:tomato">failure</span> ($\color{tomato}{X=0}$) is $\color{tomato}{q=1-p}$.
-   $X$ has a <span style="color:dodgerblue">**Bernoulli Distribution**</span> with probability mass function

$$f(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
p^x(1-p)^{1-x} & \mbox{for } x \in \left\{ 0, 1 \right \} \\
0 , & \mbox{otherwise}
\end{array} \right.$$

## A Formula for the Binomial Distribution

---

Let random variable $X$ be the number of successes out of $n$ trials, where <span style="color:dodgerblue">**each trial is identical and independent**</span>.

-   $X$ has a <span style="color:dodgerblue">**Binomial Distribution**</span>, written $\color{dodgerblue}{X \sim \mbox{Binom}(n,p)}$.
-   The probability mass function is

$$f(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
\left( \begin{array}{c} n\\ x \end{array} \right) p^x(1-p)^{n-x} & \mbox{for } x =0,1,2, \ldots , n \\
0 & \mbox{otherwise} 
\end{array} \right. $$

## Expected Value and Variance of Binomial Distributions

---

-   The expected value can be calculated with the shortcut $\color{dodgerblue}{E(X) = np}$.
-   The variance can be calculated with the shortcut $\color{dodgerblue}{\mbox{Var}(X) = np(1-p) = npq}$.

## Binomial Distribution Functions in R

---

In R, the we can use the functions:

-   `dbinom(x, n, p)` calculates the probability of <span style="color:dodgerblue">exactly $x$ successes</span> out $n$ trials, $\color{dodgerblue}{p(x)=P(X=x)}$.
-   `pbinom(x, n, p)` calculates the probability of <span style="color:tomato">at most $x$ successes</span> out $n$ trials, $\color{tomato}{F(x)=P(X \leq x)}$.
-   `rbinom(m, n, p)` <span style="color:dodgerblue">randomly sample</span> $m$ values from $X \sim \mbox{Binom}(n, p)$ (with replacement).
-   `qbinom(q, n, p)` compute the <span style="color:dodgerblue">q^th^ quantile</span>.

# Appendix A: Summary of Common Discrete Random Variables {#sec-append}

---

## The Binomial Distribution {#sec-append-binom}

---

$X \sim \mbox{Binom}(n,p)$ is number of successes from $n$ identical and independent trials each with probability of success $p$.


$$f(x; n, p) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \left( \begin{array}{c} n\\ x \end{array} \right) p^x(1-p)^{n-x} \ \ & \mbox{for } x =0,1,2, \ldots , n\\    & \\    0 \ \ & \mbox{otherwise} \end{array} \right.$$

- The expected value is $E(X) = \mu_X = np$.
- The variance is $\mbox{Var} (X) = \sigma_X^2 = np(1-p)$.
- Use `dbinom(x, n, p)` to calculate $p(x) = P(X = x)$.
- Use `pbinom(x, n, p)` to calculate $F(x) = P(X \leq x)$.
- Use `rbinom(m, n, p)` to generate a random sample of size $m$ from population $X \sim \mbox{Binom}(n,p)$.
- Use `qbinom(q, n, p)` to find the q^th^ percentile of $X \sim \mbox{Binom}(n,p)$.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| output: true
par(mfrow=c(1,2))  # plot in a 1 by 2 array
x <- 0:20  # vector of values 1, 2, ..., 20

# plot pmf n=40 and p = 0.25
plot(x, dbinom(x, size=40, prob=0.25), 
     type='p')  # point plot

# plot cdf n=40 and p = 0.25

     main='X ~ Binom(40, 0.25)',
     ylab='Probability',
     xlab ='At most x Successes',
     lwd=3)
```

## The Discrete Uniform Distribution {#sec-append-unif}

---

There are $k$ distinct outcomes each with an equal likelihood of occurring. 

$$f(x; k) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \dfrac{1}{k} \ \ & \mbox{for } x = 1, 2, \ldots,  k\\ 0 \ \ & \mbox{otherwise} \end{array} \right.$$

- The expected value is $\displaystyle E(X) = \mu_X = \frac{k+1}{2}$.
- The variance is $\displaystyle \mbox{Var} (X) = \sigma_X^2 = \frac{k^2-1}{12}$.
- Note functions such as `dunif()`, `punif()`, `runif()`, and `qunif()` are for the **continuous** (not discrete) uniform distribution.
- It is typically easier to calculate probabilities directly rather than use technology.


```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| output: true
par(mfrow=c(1,2))  # plot in a 1 by 2 array
x.min <- 1
x.max <- 6
x <- x.min:x.max  # vector of integers  x.min,  ..., x.max
p.x <- rep(1/(x.max - x.min+1), length(x) ) 
c.x <- p.x * (x)

plot(x, p.x, 
     type='p',  # point plot
     main='PMF')  

plot(x, c.x, 
     type='s',  # stairs plot
     main='CDF') 
```

## The Geometric Distribution {#sec-append-geom}

---

$X \sim \mbox{Geom}(p)$ is the number of failures that occur before the first success, where $p$ denotes the probability of a success and $q=1-p$ is the probability of a failure.

$$f(x; p) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} q^xp  \ \ & \mbox{for }  x = 0, 1, 2, \ldots  \\
0 & \mbox{otherwise} \end{array} \right.  .$$

- The expected value is $E(X) = \mu_X = \dfrac{q}{p}$.
- The variance is $\mbox{Var} (X) = \sigma_X^2 = \dfrac{q}{p^2}$.
- Use `dgeom(x, p)` to calculate $p(x) = P(X = x)$.
- Use `pgeom(x, p)` to calculate $F(x) = P(X \leq x)$.
- Use `rgeom(m, p)` to generate a random sample of size $m$ from population $X \sim \mbox{Geom}(p)$.
- Use `qgeom(q, p)` to find the q^th^ percentile of $X \sim \mbox{Geom}(p)$.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| output: true
par(mfrow=c(1,2))  # plot in a 1 by 2 array
x <- 0:8 

plot(x, dgeom(x, prob=0.75), 
     type='p',  # point plot
     main='PMF')  

plot(x, pgeom(x, prob=0.75),
     type='s',  # stairs plot
     main='CDF') 
```

## The Poisson Distribution {#sec-append-pois}

---

$X \sim \mbox{Pois}(\lambda)$ is the number of times an event occurs in a fixed time period, where $\lambda$ denotes the mean number of occurrences in the given time period.


$$f(x; \lambda) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}  e^{-\lambda} \dfrac{\lambda^x}{x!} \ \ & \mbox{for } x = 0, 1, 2, \ldots  \\
0 & \mbox{otherwise} \end{array} \right. .$$

- The expected value is $E(X) = \mu_X = \lambda$.
- The variance is $\mbox{Var} (X) = \sigma_X^2 =  \lambda$.
- Use `dpois(x, lambda)` to calculate $p(x) = P(X = x)$.
- Use `ppois(x, lambda)` to calculate $F(x) = P(X \leq x)$.
- Use `rpois(m, lambda)` to generate a random sample of size $m$ from population $X \sim \mbox{Pois}(\lambda)$.
- Use `qpois(q, lambda)` to find the q^th^ percentile of $X \sim \mbox{Pois}(\lambda)$.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| output: true
par(mfrow=c(1,2))  # plot in a 1 by 2 array
x <- 0:15  # creates vector of possible occurrences
lam <- 5  # on average 5 occurrence per time period

plot(x, dpois(x, lam), 
     type='p',  # point plot
     main='PMF')  

plot(x, ppois(x, lam),

# Appendix B: Additional Notes {#sec-append-b}

## Why Divide By $k!$? {#sec-append-why}

---

Where does $k!$ possible ways of permuting the order come from?

-   The <span style="color:dodgerblue">**symmetric group**</span> $\color{dodgerblue}{S_k}$ on $k$ items consists of all the possible ways of permuting the order of the $k$ items.
-   Each element corresponds to a permutation applied to the group of $k$ items.
- For example $S_3$ is the symmetric group on three items.
    -   The identity element is $(1,2,3)$ which does not change the ordering of items $1, 2, 3$.
    -   The element $(1, \color{tomato}{3}, \color{tomato}{2})$ is the transpose of items 2 and 3.
    -   The element $(3, 1, 2)$ is a composition of two transpositions:
      - First transpose items 1 and 2, that is element $(\color{tomato}{2}, \color{tomato}{1}, 3)$.
      - Then transpose items 1 and 3 to get $(\color{tomato}{3}, 1, \color{tomato}{2})$.
-   The number of elements in the group is called the <span style="color:dodgerblue">**order of the group**</span> and denoted $\color{dodgerblue}{|S_k|}$.
-   For example, $S_3$ has $|S_3|=6=3!$ elements that can be represented as 

$$(1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 2, 1), \mbox{ and } (3, 1, 2).$$

- In fact, for any symmetric group we have $\color{dodgerblue}{|S_k|=k!}$.
- <span style="color:dodgerblue">**Thus, there are $k!$ ways of permutating the order of $k$ items.**</span>

## Typsetting Arrays in LaTeX {#sec-append-latex}

---

-   The `array` environment is started with `\begin{array}`.
-   Next we indicate how many columns and how each column is aligned.
    -   `{ll}` means two columns aligned to the left.
    -   `{lrc}` would be three columns: the first aligned left, then right, then the last column is centered.
    -   We use the `&` symbol to indicate a column break.
    -   We use `\\` to indicate a row break.
-   If we want a big curly brace on the left of the array, enter `\left\{` before beginning the array.
-   We do not want a brace on the other side of the array, so we use `\right.` to close off the left brace without using any matching symbol on the right.
-   We use `\mbox{otherwise}` to type the text *otherwise* inside the equation.
